# charge-limiter
Set charge limit for MacBooks.

## Description

This utility is written in Javascript Application Scripting (or JXA) using Apple's Script Editor.

The source code can be viewed by opening `src/charge-limiter.app` in Script Editor. This file is different from the `charge-limiter.app` provided in the [release](https://github.com/godly-devotion/charge-limiter/releases) page.

The companion `smcutil` binary was copied from [this repository](https://github.com/sicreative/BatteryStatusShow/blob/master/BatteryStatusShow/smcutil/Products/usr/local/bin/smcutil). The source code for `smcutil` is also available there.
